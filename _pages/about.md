I'm a data scientist who is in her final year at the University of Rwanda(Nyarugenge Campus).

I am a responsible and hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person. 
I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
I am a quick learner and this helps me to fit in new environments, it might at work as I
did in my internship or my daily life. I am someone who is always on time in everything that I do.
